## Pre-requirements

### Linux

1. Install Go 1.22 either from your distro's package repositories or by following [instructions on Golang's site](https://go.dev/doc/install).

   **Tip:** If you're using Ubuntu 23.10 or lower, Go version in official repositories is going to be too old.
   You can get the latest version by adding [the PPA listed on Go wiki](https://go.dev/wiki/Ubuntu) and installing `golang` package after.

2. Install SDL2 from your distro's package repositories. For additional 
help follow [instructions](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation#linuxunix).
3. Install raylib-go requirements following [intructions for your distro](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements).

### Windows

1. Install [Go for Windows x86-64](https://go.dev/dl/).
2. Install [MinGW-w64](https://winlibs.com/) and add bin directory to PATH. It is required both by SDL2 and raylib-go.
3. Install SDL2

> [!NOTE]
> Below installation instruction of SDL2 is dedicated for 64 bit system version.

   1. Download [SDL2 for MinGW](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases) and extract zip content.
   2. From SDL's *x86_64-w64-mingw32* copy and merge *bin*, *lib* and *share* directories with their respective directories (same directory name) in MinGW directory and MinGW's *x86_64-w64-mingw32* directory.
   3. From SDL's *x86_64-w64-mingw32/include/SDL2* directory copy all its content to *include* directory in MinGW directory and MinGW's *x86_64-w64-mingw32/include* directory.

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to copy only *x86_64-w64-mingw32/include/SDL2* content and not the whole directory as otherwise it may result in import problems.
